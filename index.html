            <p>Relocation, medical expenses – there are a lot of reasons why upstanding citizens can find themselves in a situation where they had to accumulate credit card debt and don’t know how to get out of it. But, you’re not alone with that situation – millions of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and a single accident can be enough to seriously shake up their financials.

</p>
				   <p>Many find themselves stuck in a recurring cycle of minimum payments – month over month, year over year, accumulating more and more debt.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-title">A Choice Many Don't Think Of</h2>

            <p>Fortunately, there is a program called <strong>Freedom Debt Relief</strong> to help US Citizens to 
			<a href="https://securetrack.info/base2.php">get out of this downward spiral.
			</a>They consolidate all owed debt into a single monthly payment and 
			<strong>reduce the amount in total</strong> by negotiating with the credit card company on a bigger scale thus easing the monthly burden.

            <h2 class="sub-title">Newly Found Freedom With FDR</h2>

            <p>By getting the “Freedom Debt Relief Plan” <strong>your debt shrinks month after month</strong> and before you know it, you’re out of debt – significantly reducing the time you need to get rid of the debt. How do they do that? With the negotiating power of a few thousand people and billions in settled debt they work with credit cards companies to settle debt for consumers who are struggling and potentially avert bankruptcy.</p>

            <p>*Clients who make all their monthly program deposits pay approximately 50% of their enrolled balance
                before fees, or 65% to 85% including fees, over 24 to 48 months (some programs lengths can go higher).
                Not all clients are able to complete our program for various reasons, including their ability to save
                sufficient funds. Our estimates are based on prior results, which will vary depending on your specific
                circumstances. We do not guarantee that your debts will be resolved for a specific amount or percentage
                or within a specific period of time. We do not assume your debts, make monthly payments to creditors or
                provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or legal advice or credit repair services. Our service is not
                available in all states and our fees may vary from state to state. Please contact a tax professional to
                discuss potential tax consequences of less than full balance debt resolution. Read and understand all
                program materials prior to enrollment. The use of debt settlement services will likely adversely affect
                your creditworthiness, may result in you being subject to collections or being sued by creditors or
                collectors and may increase the outstanding balances of your enrolled accounts due to the accrual of
                fees and interest. However, negotiated settlements we obtain on your behalf resolve the entire account,
                including all accrued fees and interest. C.P.D. Reg. No. T.S. 12-03825.</p>
